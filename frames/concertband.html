<div class="title">Concert and Symphonic Band</div>
<p>	Westford Academy currently offers two concert band opportunities for band students along with one Concert Percussion class (C Block). The two band classes are Concert Band (A Block) and Symphonic Band (B Block). Both classes are full year courses. All freshmen interested in taking a band class are placed into Concert Band. Sophomores and upperclassmen can elect to be placed in Symphonic Band for a more challenging repertiore of concert literature. Upperclassmen enrolled in the Symphonic Band will receive honors credit.</p>
<p>Each of the concert bands performs in several performances held at Westford Academy annually. For these concerts, unless otherwise specified, the dress code for men is a tuxedo (or black suit), white shirt, black bow tie, black socks, and formal black shoes (sneakers are not permitted). The dress code for women is a floor length black dress or pants, a modest black top, and black shoes.</p>
