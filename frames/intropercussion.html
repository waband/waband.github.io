<p class="redText">Due to over-enrollment in other music courses, Intro to Percussion will not be offered during the 2013-2014 school year. It will be offered again during the 2014-2015 school year. Please <a href="javascript:swapTabFromFrame('frames/contact.html','contactTab');">contact Mr. Arsenault</a> if you are interested in learing percussion instruments during the 2013-2014 school year.</p>
<p>This semester course offers a hands-on introduction to drumming skills and the percussive arts. Students will experience drum-set playing, stick control, siple rhythm readying, hand drumming, melodic percussion, and modern theatrical percussion performance. Students will practice on acoustic and electric drum-sets, African and Latin percussion instruments, concert percussion, and marching percussion instruments. This class is open to any student at Westford Academy, including students with proficiency on other instruments. Students completing the Intro to Percussion course may be considered for enrollment in the concert percussion course the following year.</p>
