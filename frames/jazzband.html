<p>Westford Academy currently offers two jazz bands opportunities for students with different levels of experience. The Repertoire Jazz Band is geared at freshmen and students with little prior jazz experience. This group is open to all students. The Festival Jazz Band is a higher level competitive jazz band. Auditions are usually necessary for students who wish to be a part of this group. The Festival Jazz Band rehearses every Tuesday from 6:30 PM to 8:30 PM. The Improv Band rehearses afterschool on Tuesdays from 2 PM to 3 PM.</p>
<p>All jazz bands are subject to the school-wide activity fee of $50. If you have not paid this fee for another club, please bring in a check made out to Westford Academy to one of the first meetings. Marching Band members have already paid this fee.</p>
<p>All jazz band members are encouraged to download and sign-up for Spotify to access the suggested listening for each ensemble. Developing subconscious jazz insticts requires significant amounts of listening! Spotify is free and is a great resource for accessing classic jazz recordings. Spotify can be installed <a href="http://www.spotify.com/us/start/" target="_blank">here</a>. Mr. Arsenault's recommended jazz playlist can be found <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/1258430887/playlist/3xfCbw2vc57YtIl85mYG7V" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
