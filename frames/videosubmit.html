<div class="title">Video Submission Guidelines</div><br />
<p>All video submissions for playing  assessments must be uploaded to Google Drive and shared with Mr. Arsenault. For  each assignment, you are welcome to submit a cut-and-paste version of your  video, but each assessment must be combined into a single video unless  otherwise noted. This video does <u>not</u> need to be in an extremely high  resolution; medium to large is fine. Free movie software should be more than  capable of creating such a video. If you cannot do this at home, you may work  on the project on one of the music department computers at school.</p>
<p>The video  must be shared with either garsenault@westfordk12.us or  westfordacademybands@gmail.com.</p>
<p>You must  continue to host the files on your own Google Drive account for your entire  career at WA. This is your four year portfolio; if you delete any files, you  delete my copy as well. I do not have enough storage for 120 students, so this  is an important responsibility. I encourage you to create a folder to store all  of these files. The suggested name for this folder is <strong>NAME_Band_Portfolio</strong>.</p>
<p>You should  name the recording and indicate what assignment you are recording (e.g. <strong>Arsenault-midterm-2013</strong>).</p>
